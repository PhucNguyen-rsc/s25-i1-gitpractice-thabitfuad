The article caught my attention because it highlights how the evolution of 
AI is reshaping the field of software engineering. The idea of AI-powered tools 
simplifying development resonates with the shift we're seeing toward 
making programming more accessible. Itâ€™s fascinating to think about how 
these tools will democratize software creation, enabling even 
non-technical users to contribute meaningfully to projects that previously 
required extensive coding knowledge.

Another aspect that stood out is the concept of cross-functional 
engineering teams. Breaking down silos between disciplines could lead to 
better collaboration and innovation, which is crucial as software becomes 
more integrated into every aspect of our lives. Combining these trends 
with low-code and AI solutions could redefine the role of developers, 
pushing them to focus on creative problem-solving and strategic design 
rather than repetitive tasks. This transformative shift makes me excited 
to see how these predictions will materialize in the coming years
